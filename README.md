# Project 3 - PawHub
## Overview
PawHub was the fourth and final project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. This was a full-stack, group project done in a group of 4 over a week. As a group, we decided to build a dog rehoming app based off the [Dog's Trust](https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/) website.

## Brief
* Build a full-stack application - by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from an SQL database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* Have a visually impressive design
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessibl

## Planning
For this project we were given the opportunity to choose if we wanted to work in teams or solo. The four of us got on really well during the course and hadn't worked together before, so we decided to work together for our final project. From the very initial conversation, we all set out what we personally wanted to achieve from our final project. We all agreed that our main goal was to create a smooth, slick and polished app that was mobile compatible. We also wanted to do a website clone as none of us had cloned anything for a previous project. Not only would this be a great time saver as it takes away having to design the look of a website, but also it shows that we can built an app according to a client's desires.

After some discussion of things we have in common, it was quite obvious that we all shared a passion for dogs and finding homes for them. We had a look at a few dog rehoming websites and Dog's Trust was the one that appealed to us the most, due to it's fun colours and layout. From there on, we set up to build a better version of their website.

We started by creating an ERD diagram to plan the back-end models and establish the relationships between them. We wanted to push ourselves and our SQL database abilities by creating many-to-many relationships:
